### Security
- Secure defaults: `shareable_link_enabled = false` (prevents unauthorized access)
- Secure defaults: `file_copy_enabled = false` (prevents data exfiltration)
- Copy/paste enabled by default for usability (`copy_paste_enabled = true`)
- Diagnostics integration for audit logging and compliance (PCI-DSS, HIPAA, SOC 2)
- Comprehensive validation to prevent misconfigurations
- No hardcoded credentials or secrets
